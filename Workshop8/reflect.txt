By this point I have become quite comfortable with "interfaces", abstract base classes, and concrete classes. 
It was interesting to see how overloading the insertion and extration operator on the interface allowed for me to 
use that in the derived classes. I think the biggest problems i had this workshop were with areas that had to do 
with delete[] and memory. I find memory to be one of the most difficult topics as i often doubt myself with it. 
With this workshop I have learned that deleting pointers that are uninitialized can be problematic so initializing
 pointers to nullptr in the constructors initialization area seems to be the standard practice. Overall, this 
 workshop in combination with the previous one helped me prepare for the in class quiz very well and has made me 
 think about object oriented programing in a new way.
