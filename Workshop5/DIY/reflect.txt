The challenge in this workshop came from the lab as it was the first time dealing with operator overloading. 
The DIY on the other hand was quite easy as it was pretty much the same as the lab. Some of the obstacles i 
encountered in the lab included the need for using namespace std in the header file as without this my compiler
was unable to understand the << and >> operator overload functions. This gave me problems for quite some time,
but was a learning experience. With this lab i have gotten much better at understanding how to set up functions to 
return a reference to an object such as ostream or the class object. I guess another obstacle which was somewhat silly,
but still a learning expereience was that I had put my default values of ostr = cout in the header file and then copied
the prototype to the cpp file without removing the default value. Additionally, I should note that while i believe
I have the correct output for my lab, I have not submitted it yet because matrix is telling me I have memory leak issue
even though I havent used DMA in this workshop and so I have set up a meeting with the prof to discuss this. Overall,
finding my ability and understanding of what I am doing is getting much better.
