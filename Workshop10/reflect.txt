This workshop was simple with short instructions and plenty of provided code. The point was to learn how function
templates work. It was interesting thinking about how templates can be used though i have much more to learn about 
the potential and limitations they have. I think the hardest part about templates is understanding which member 
functions the template type requires especially with copy constructor. My current understanding is that if the
type is passed by value as opposed to by pointer or reference then it needs copy constructor. Additionaly const
types do not need copy constructor though i am not sure and will ask about this in class. Overall, it was an easier
workshop, but it got the point across.
