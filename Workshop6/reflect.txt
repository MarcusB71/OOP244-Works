This workshop was quite difficult and took me a very long time. I spent a long time trying to implement the copy constructor and 
copy assignment functions because i did not realize that these two are fairly standardized in their implmenetation. 
Meaning, in cases where a copy constructor and copy assignment are needed, the code within them is generally very similar. 
I spent too much time trying to figure it out myself when I should have been referencing the class material more. 
One of the biggest problems i encountered this workshop was that I did not use strcpy in the copy assingment as it was not written
in the instructions. While this should be fairly obvious, it is easy to miss things when there is so much unknown. This leads to 
my memory problem. Similar to last workshop when trying to submit, i did get the outputs to match, but i had a memory problem. 
I think there is a lot of unknown factors with memory problems that causes me to cast doubt on parts of my code that I shouldnt 
be doubting. I need to understand memory better so that I can be confident in my coding.
