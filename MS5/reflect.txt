-----------------------------------------------------------
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.

I have learned a lot about object oriented programming by completing this project. It was interesting to see how 
the application developed throughout the milestones. Especially in milestone 5 where it all came together. 
The early milestones set the foundation for the project by using polymorphic techniques such as inclusion where 
virtual functions were used to create a hierarchy of items starting from an interface to the items class and then
to the Perishable and NonPerishable classes. This polymorphism added to the capabilities of the program in much 
fewer lines of code than it otherwise would be. Similarly, the overloading of operators throughout this hierarchy
made the coding process much less tedious albeit a bit more confusing. I also have a much better understanding of
working with pointers and managing user inputs after completing this project. Finally, I am happy to have 
completed the project, but I am stil a few more projects away from feeling confident that I would be able to 
reproduce a similar product without as detailed of a guideline as was provided for this one.
