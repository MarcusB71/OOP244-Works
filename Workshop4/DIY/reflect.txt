This workshop was somewhat frustrating. For the lab there were issues when submitting as the file name and #includes
needed to be changed, there were also many getter functions that I had to create in order to acces the private member variables.
As for the DIY, or part 2, the formating of the print function was extremely tedious and the instructions were not clear.
For example, the border was not to be included in the 20 space count, which took up a lot of my time.
While I did learn more about cout methods, It was somewhat overcomplicated in my opinion. Throughout this workshop I 
have solidified my understanding of DMA, classes, constructor/destructor, and the current object.
